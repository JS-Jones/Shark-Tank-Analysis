# Shark-Tank-Analysis
This Repo is dedicated to approaching a "Shark Tank Deal" DataSet in different analytical approaches. One uses R code to identify
key findings and generate appropriate graphs. The other uses python Machine learning algorithmms to find optimal ways to predict 
wehter a deal will be made or not.

Both Folders have a final analysis paper/slideshow:
- RCodeAnalysis - FinalAnalysis.pdf
- MachineLearningAnalysis - Shark-Tank-Presentation-Slides.pdf

No significant findings were found between the company properties and its likelihood to make a deal with the sharks.
